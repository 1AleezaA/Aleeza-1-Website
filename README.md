# Eid al-Adha
A website with information on the history, purpose, correlated events, festivities, and my own personal stories of Eid al-Adha.
# What is Eid al-Adha?
> Eid al-Adha is one of the most important muslim holidays. It is celebrated on a yearly basis and honors Prophet Ibrahim's strength to obey Allah's command of sacrificing his son Ismail. This was a test from God to see if Prophet Ibrahim trusted him. Due to his willingness to sacrifice his son and obey God's command, Allah replaced Ismail with a sheep and told Prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice the sheep insead. Now, every single year, muslims around the world sacrifice a sheep, cow, goat, or camel during Eid al-Adha and distribute one third of the meat to the poor, immediate family, and friends and extended family. 
**This is red bold.**
## What is its purpose?
> To honor the devotion and trust Prophet Ibrahim had in Allah and the survival of Prophet Ibrahim's son Ismail.

> Before Eid al Adha, muslims observe a month of fasting during the islamic month of Ramadan, the ninth month of the islamic lunar calendar. On every day in this month, muslims wake up an hour before sunrise to prepare to fast and break that fast when the sunsets. The time for fasting is not the same for everyone as it depends on the sunrise and sunset times of the place a muslim resides in.

> To start the day off, muslims pray their early morning prayer. Then they start getting ready to go to the masjid to pray a special Eid prayer. After that, muslim families go to different gathrings with their friends and family. The way these gatherings function may be different in cuisine due to difference in culture.

> Fortunately, I am blessed to have much of my family located in Southern California, so for Eid we all always meet up at my grandma's house. Usually, one uncle orders a jumper for the day and all the aunts cook something for a potluck. Also, each year a different siblings (my mom and her siblings) hosts the Eid party at my gradnma's house. We have a variety of dishes ranging from chicken biryani to ras malai.
